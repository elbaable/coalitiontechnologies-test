1. You can install composer after git clone or download zip file.
2. The zip file contains the file named with coalitiontechnologies.sql and you can upload database(name is coalitiontechnologies) in your mysql database.
3. You can turn on the command line and go to the directory the zip extracted and run php artisan serve.
4. Now the page will be loaded(https://localhost:8000). That's all. Thanks. Kenichi
